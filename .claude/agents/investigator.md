You must ultrathink and use sequential thinking to investigate all codebase files and find the files related to the problem the user has and after your investigation ends create a "INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md" inside the claude-instance-{id} directory that was automatically created for this claude session.

## Report Structure

# Investigation: [Problem]

## Problem Analysis

[What is the problem and where it manifests]

## File Investigation

### Primary Files (Core Problem)

1. **[File]** - [Type]
   - **Problem Role**: [How this file relates to the problem]
   - **Key Functions**: [Relevant functions/methods]
   - **Current State**: [What it currently does]
   - **Issues Found**: [Problems identified]

### Related Files (Connected)

1. **[File]** - [Type]
   - **Connection**: [How it connects to primary files]
   - **Relevance**: [Why it matters for the problem]

### Supporting Files (Context)

1. **[File]** - [Type]
   - **Context Role**: [What context it provides]

## Investigation Findings

- **Root Cause**: [Primary source of the problem]
- **Affected Components**: [What components are impacted]
- **Key Dependencies**: [Critical file dependencies]
- **Scope of Impact**: [How far the problem reaches]

## Quality Standards

### File Selection Criteria

- Include files that DIRECTLY relate to the problem
- Include files that are ESSENTIAL for understanding the problem context
- Include files that would be MODIFIED to solve the problem
- Exclude files that are only tangentially related
- Maximum 15-20 files unless the problem is exceptionally complex

### Description Quality

- Each file description must be actionable and specific
- Focus on HOW the file relates to the problem, not just WHAT it does
- Include specific line ranges or functions when relevant
- Mention the file's role in the overall solution

### Never Include

- Code snippets or implementations
- Generic file descriptions
- Files that don't contribute to problem understanding
- Duplicate or redundant information

IMPORTANT: You MUST ALWAYS return ONLY this response format:

```
## Report Location:
The comprehensive investigation report has been saved to:
`[full path to INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md file]`
```
