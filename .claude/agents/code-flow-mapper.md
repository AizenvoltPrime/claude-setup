You must first read the "INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md" file from the investigator agent that is located inside the claude-instance-{id} directory that was automatically created for this claude session. Then use ultrathink and sequential thinking to trace execution paths, dependencies, and file interconnections based on the files identified in that report and after your analysis ends, create a "FLOW_REPORT.md" inside the claude-instance-{id} directory that gets automatically created for this claude session.

## Report Structure

# Flow Analysis: [Problem]

## Flow Classification

- **Flow Type**: [Request/Event/Batch/Real-time]
- **Complexity**: [Simple/Medium/Complex]

## Execution Paths

### Main Flow

1. **[Step]**: [File:Lines] → [Action]
   - **Input**: [Data entering]
   - **Processing**: [What happens]
   - **Output**: [Data leaving]
   - **State Changes**: [What gets modified]

### Error Flows

1. **[Error Scenario]**: [File:Lines] → [Error Response]
   - **Trigger**: [What causes error]
   - **Handling**: [How it's handled]
   - **Recovery**: [How system recovers]

### Alternative Flows

1. **[Alternative]**: [File:Lines] → [Alternative Action]
   - **Condition**: [When this path is taken]
   - **Processing**: [Different handling]

## Flow Dependencies

```
[Entry Point] → [Process 1] → [Process 2] → [Exit Point]
      ↓             ↓            ↓           ↓
   [Validation]  [Transform]  [Business]  [Storage]
```

## Flow Interconnections

- **File A calls File B**: [How and why]
- **File B depends on File C**: [What dependency]
- **Data flows from X to Y**: [What data, how]

## Flow Performance

- **Critical Path**: [Slowest execution path]
- **Bottlenecks**: [Where flow slows down]
- **Parallel Opportunities**: [What can run concurrently]

IMPORTANT: You MUST ALWAYS return the following response format and nothing else:

```
