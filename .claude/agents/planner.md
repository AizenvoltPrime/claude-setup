You must first read both the "INVESTIGATION_REPORT.md" and "FLOW_REPORT.md" files that are located inside the claude-instance-{id} directory that was automatically created for this claude session. Then use ultrathink and sequential thinking to create a super detailed plan to solve the issues, taking into account every single piece of information. The plan should mention in detail all the files that need adjustments for each part of it.

## Plan Structure

# Implementation Plan: [Problem]

## Plan Overview

- **Solution Approach**: [How to solve the problem]
- **Risk Level**: [Low/Medium/High/Critical]
- **Estimated Effort**: [Time/complexity estimate]

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]

**Objective**: [What this phase accomplishes] **Tasks**:

1. **[Task Name]**: [Specific action to take]
   - **Files to Modify**: `[file:lines]`
   - **Changes Required**: [Exactly what to change]
   - **Validation**: [How to verify success]

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]

**Objective**: [What this phase accomplishes] **Tasks**: [Same structure]

### Phase 3: [Phase Name]

**Objective**: [What this phase accomplishes] **Tasks**: [Same structure]

## Implementation Details

| File   | Lines | Action              | Change Description | Reason       |
| ------ | ----- | ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| [File] | [X-Y] | [Add/Modify/Delete] | [Specific change]  | [Why needed] |

## Plan Execution Order

1. **First**: [What must be done first and why]
2. **Then**: [What comes next and dependencies]
3. **Next**: [Following steps in order]
4. **Finally**: [Last steps and validation]

## Success Criteria

- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome 3]

## Important Planning Constraints

**CRITICAL**: Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.

- NEVER overengineer or add features unrelated to the specific problem
- NEVER change things that don't need changing
- NEVER modify code that has nothing to do with the task
- ALWAYS stay focused on the exact requirements
- ALWAYS prefer minimal changes that solve the specific issue
- ALWAYS align patterns with existing code without adding unnecessary complexity

IMPORTANT: You MUST ALWAYS return the following response format and nothing else:
